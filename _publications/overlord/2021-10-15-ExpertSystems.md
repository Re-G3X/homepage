abstract: 'The present research introduces an evolutionary algorithm able to procedurally generate dungeon maps containing locked door missions. The evolutionary algorithm evolves a tree structure, which encodes dungeons, aiming to generate levels close to the input configuration provided by a game designer. The tree structure holds information about the number of rooms, connections between them, and their position within a 2D map. The proposed encoding also allows evolving semantic information about the narrative of the game. This is done by feasibly setting keys and locks throughout the dungeons for locked door missions. The generated dungeons are then evaluated computationally and as a proof of concept using an adventure game prototype. A total of 70 players evaluated the contents and the results show that the procedurally generated levels are perceived as more human-made, fun, and difficult than their human-made counterparts for most cases.'
