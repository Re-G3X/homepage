abstract: "We propose a system able to orchestrate the procedural generation of three creative facets (levels, narrative, and rules), using quality-diversity algorithms to promote diversity while converging to the desired solutions and able to satisfy different player's profiles. We aim to facilitate the project's reproducibility and extension by presenting the system's architecture and high-level design decisions and showcasing how we decoupled it enough to change algorithms. Our generation starts with a grammar-based quest generator that works as a frame for two quality-diversity algorithms: a level generator, which also creates locked-door puzzles, and an enemy generator, which selects their visuals based on their weapons. A rule-based profile analysis uses a pretest questionnaire to classify the player into four profiles, and the quest generator creates different content for each of them. We use a game prototype to test our system with over 83 players, playing over 204 levels and answering a posttest questionnaire after each. Results show the game and contents were well received, and there was a difference in perception between profiles. Players who played content based on their profile enjoyed it more than those playing content from another profile."
