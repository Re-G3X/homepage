abstract: "This research uses Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to aid search-based (SB) algorithms to improve level generation for physics-based puzzle games. These algorithmsâ€™ performance are improved by reducing simulation time when the ML techniques are applied. Classification algorithms prevent levels with undesired traits to be evaluated during the simulation phase of the SB procedures. An Angry Birds clone is used for conducting the experiments and results report improvement using the combined approach against every SB algorithm by itself."
