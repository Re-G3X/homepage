abstract: "Recognizing digital games as a significant global cultural force offering diverse opportunities across entertainment, education, health, and other domains, the international Human-Computer Interaction community has focused on game research. However, a need persists to bridge geographical contexts and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address this, the fourth edition of WIPlay has evolved from three successful Brazilian national workshops into an international platform at INTERACT 2025. We broadened its scope by incorporating diverse cultural perspectives on player experience, inclusive design, and global challenges in the gaming industry. By attracting international HCI researchers, game developers, and game user researchers, WIPlay provides a collaborative space for discussing, exploring, and defining future directions for the field."
