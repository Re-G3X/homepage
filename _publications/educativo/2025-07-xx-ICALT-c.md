abstract: "The low recycling rate in emerging countries contrasts with the efforts of public policies and educational initiatives , highlighting the need for new approaches to environmental awareness. This study proposes a serious game called 'Sustainable Planet: Mission Preserve' as an educational tool for teaching sustainable practices. The game emphasizes solid waste management and proper disposal, engaging players in challenges that simulate these actions. To analyze the game's awareness potential, we conducted a quasi-experimental one-group study (N = 32) using pre-and post-interaction questionnaires with the game. This allowed us to assess its impact on participants' ability to classify waste type and its correct disposal. The results indicate a significant increase in participants' awareness, contributing to educational technologies for environmental education."
