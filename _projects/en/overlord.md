abstract: Overlord is a Content Orchestrator, a system that starts and coordinates two or more procedural content generators. Currently, Overlord manages generators of Levels (dungeons, rooms, and object positioning), Rules (enemy parameters, such as life, speed, damage, weapon, and movement type), and Narrative (quests). The orchestrator also considers player profiles and adapts generated content according to the defined profile.
